# SmartMed
Well SmartMed, as the name suggests, solves problems in medical sector by making use of <B>Machine Learning and Blockchain</b>. 
Well let us explain how did we come us with SmartMed, while looking for projects we found two problems that we felt can be solved by our idea. The first problem was related to traditional method of medical record storage and accessing, as the reports in the paper format can be damaged, lost or even destroyed. Another problem that we found was the lack of practical training for the medical students in low-tier colleges, which makes it difficult for them to obtain their registration, even if you observe in most govt. colleges most of the senior doctor attend their patients only after tests and prescription by their students, therefore if there was a way to predict if the patient has a severe disease this step could be done faster, and it would definitly benefit the trainees and the patients.
